Hey! - From the title, this might be abit confusing let me give you a little summary.

I started my Software Developing career at AutoTrader
![Alt Text](https://cdn.freelogovectors.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/autotrader-logo.png "AT Logo")

a UK Automotive company based in MCR. Coming through as an apprentice, finshing as a junior.
After feeling it was time to move, I had to transition away from everything that could have masqueraded my developing skills by moving to a new company, new stack, new role, new people and new industry.

This is how I found it.
